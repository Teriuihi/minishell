goal:
    1, Two hashtables, one current env, other extended (carried over to child process with export being added to these)
    2, In the beginning all of them are exported since its just the env var
    3, When adding an non-exported var, add it to current_env with the flag non_exported

#SIGNALS
    we need a global struct to hold info about exit status, pid, and if it was sigint or sigquit etc
